Github Repository for the 1.12.2 Minecraft Among Us mod.

## Wiki
Look for red desert-well looking structures in Mesa biomes. Inside of them, you can find 1 Hieroglyph block, mine it with a diamond or higher pickaxe to get such block.
With 2 Hieroglyphs, an Iron Ingot, 2 Glass Blocks and a Stone Button you can craft an Emergency Meeting Button, place it down and right click it to spawn the Impostor.
The higher it's health, the stronger the Impostor is. Not only that, to prevent players from pillaring up with blocks or running away, in it's second stage it will vent/teleport to you. In it's third stage it can also freeze you in place, although you can bounce it away with a shield.

## Found Issues / Bugs?
You can report them on my Discord Server in [#Amjad](https://discord.com).

## Have suggestions?
I most likely won't add anything new.
Although I do have a suggestion for you, try naming the Impostor "Amjad".
